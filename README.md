# Call Center (PowerBI)

I analyzed a fictious Call Center wich has a 30,000-row data source. I solved the following problems:

1. **Total Number of Calls**: We need to track and display the total numbers of calls received by our call center over a specified period
2. **Total Call Duriation in Hours**: It is crucial to understand the total amount of time our call center staff spends on calls in hours, wich can help us resource allocation and capacity planning
3. **Total Call Duration in Minutes**: Similar to the total call duration hours, this KPI provides the total time but in minutes, offering a more granular view of call durations.
4. **Average Call Duration in Minutes**: To assess the efficiency of our agents, we need to calculate and display the average call duration in minutes. This metric can help identify trends in call handling.
5. **Response Time Percentige**: Response time is a critical factor in customer satisfaction. This KPI should display the percentage of calls answered within a perdefined time frame, helping us gauge our ability to provide promt service.

Furthermore, my learning project contains:

- **3 tables**: 1 fact, 1 dimension, 1 measure

- **7 explicit measures**

- **12 visualizations**

- **2 pages**
